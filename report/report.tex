\section{Introduction}
This document describes the architecture of the forum feature added to the CSA application
as part of the assignment submission for the SE31520 module at Aberystwyth University. The
following sections describe the design and implementation choices made during the development,
alongside testing performed and the implementation of the REST API. The report finishes with
the summary of the activities performed to achieve "flair" marks and sums up the work with
a critical evaluation.
